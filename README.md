# ResourcePack
**Description:**
My resource pack for Minecraft 1.8.9.
These textures are originally handcrafted from scratch, after about... _one month of learning pixel art_. Feel free to give me feedback via discord:
`Zackorai famora#3200`

**Please note**: This pack is __currently 30% done__. All resources may be subjected to change at any time, without prior warning. Fortunately, you can use the previous commits to pull your favourite textures, however compactability is not guarenteed.

# Installation Instructions: 
Download the pack using the releases page (Coming soon), or the big green button. Unzip the pack and drag the folder dubbed "The Judges pack" into your resource pack folders.

__For Windows__, use the command key *Windows + R* (⊞+R) and paste the following text: ``%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks``

__For Mac__, use the command key ⌘+⇧+G and paste the following: ``~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/resourcepacks``

Installers will come soon.™
